# Vidly Front-End

This is an application that follows along with a react tutorial with Mosh.

It's initially setup using [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built from there.

The goals of this project are:
- [x] Create an application using React
- [x] Learn more about implementing JS
- [x] Properly handling Promises and Async in JS
- [x] Connecting to a self built API from React
- [x] Learning how to implement libraries in a scalable way
- [x] Understand hooks
- [x] Handle JWT
- [x] Handle Permission levels
- [ ] Convert classes that can converted to functions with hooks
- [ ] Implement Context API

If you have any questions about this application, please ask!

## How to Use

It's as easy as hitting run! Use the command `npm start` and you'll be ready to go!

The only thing that should be changed is the API endpoint.

I will be posting a link to a working API backend when it is properly configured.

## Things yet to be Implemented

- Profile page
- Rentals page
- Context for different pages

## Current known issues

- Expired tokens are not removed
- Database shows "No Movies" message as it loads data from database
- Like button data does not get sent to database
